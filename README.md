# Community Clothing Swap or Give and Get
A web application that allows families to swap childrens clothing.

## Purpose
Typically mothers take out grown clothes and donate them to a thrift store or another non-profit organization.

## How it Works
 Families signup on our platform. Then they add children profiles to their family account. Next the family has the ablity to give clothes by creating a package.  This package will have details such as: gender, size, quanity of each item.  Once a package is created, it will be visable to any families wanting to get clothes matching their specific package request. When a getter finds the desired package, they have the ability to create a meeting location together.  Giver and getting will meet at mutual established location to physically exhange the package in person.
